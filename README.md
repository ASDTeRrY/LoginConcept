If you take a look at the original design, you will notice that there are some differences.
For example, the input fields are rectangular in shape, mine are rounded. Also when you touch the input, 
the Log In/Sign Up label should appear on top of the keyboard, whereas in my case it just scales down the logo 
and the background image.
